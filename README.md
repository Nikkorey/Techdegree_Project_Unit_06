## **Description**

For this project, I had to create a browser version of “Wheel of Success”, a word guessing game where players will click letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess a random phrase.

Using JavaScript, I had to create an array of phrases and write functions to choose a random phrase from that array, split the phrase into letters, and put those letters onto the game board.

Each time the player guesses a letter, I needed to add programming to compare the letter the player has chosen with the random phrase. If the letter is in the phrase, I also needed to add programming to update the game board with the chosen letters.

A player can keep choosing letters until they make five incorrect guesses. If the letter they chose isn’t in the phrase, I needed to add programming that will remove one of the player’s 5 guesses.

If the player completes the phrase before they run out of guesses, a winning screen will display. If the player guesses incorrectly 5 times, a losing screen will display.

A player can guess a letter only once. After they’ve guessed a letter, I needed to add programming to disable that letter.

I also went for the Exceeds Expectations Grading where I had to:

Create CSS transitions for each letter in the phrase display as they are revealed.
Add a button to the “success” and “failure” screens that reset the game. I had to recreate the buttons for the keyboard, generate a new random phrase, and set the number of misses to zero.
Browsers tested for compatibility:

Chrome
Grade: Exceeds Expectations
